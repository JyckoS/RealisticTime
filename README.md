# RealisticTime
Your solution to sync real-life time with Minecraft's Time!

Hello!
RealisticTime plugin sync time between real-time and minecraft-time every certain second.
And it sync counts on the hour. Example, its 11PM, dont matter the minutes, as this only uses the 11 PM to set the world time.
